# Tangle Scripts

Expect was originally written in TCL, so I have a [TCL](tangle.tcl) script.
if you have expect, you'll have TCL, so that tangle should be fine. The
tangle script doesn't work with any base TCL install (verion 8.5 and up).

I will also be including some Python `pexpect` examples, which means
people many not have TCL installed. My [python tangle](tangle.py) is 
an fairly close duplication of the TCL version. It should run with 
any python3 version and not require any additional modules.

Both scripts will provide the same output, so use any one you wish.
