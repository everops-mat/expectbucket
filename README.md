Various Expect Scripts and templates I have put together

## generic

The [generic](generic.md) template is a good start. This will be able to
ssh to a remote system using a username and password. If the connection 
is setup to NOT require a password, it should still work. You can enter
a gibberish for the ssh password. 

You'll probably need to adjust how it figures out the remote command failed.
